# Diabetes Detection GUI

This project presents a MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to enter personal information related to diabetes and obtain a prediction of whether or not they have the disease. The project uses a multilayer neural network and has been trained using the backpropagation algorithm.

## Installation Instructions

1. Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
2. Download the repository or clone the project to your local machine.
3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the `main.m` file to start the GUI.

## Usage Instructions

1. Fill out the form with the requested information, such as age, glucose level, blood pressure, etc.
2. Click the "Predict" button to obtain the results.
3. The GUI will display whether the prediction indicates the presence or absence of diabetes.

## Project Structure

The project follows the following folder and file structure:

- main.m                           # Main file to run the GUI
- NN_training.m                    # Implementation of the neural network and backpropagation algorithm
- data_preparation.ipynb           # Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and preparation
- data
  - diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv  # Dataset used to train the neural network
  - training.csv
  - testing.csv
- README.md                        # File containing information about the project
